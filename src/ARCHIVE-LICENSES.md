# Archive dependencies and redistribution notices

The plugin invokes unmodified official 7-Zip binaries as separate processes from
7zip-bin-full@26.3.1 (7-Zip 26.03). No system 7z/tar dependency, runtime downloads,
installer, shell execution or custom fork is used. Keep the npm dependency and its
platform-specific binaries, DLLs and License.txt files together when distributing.
The npm wrapper's MIT license does NOT relicense 7-Zip binaries.

Upstream binaries/source and matching release:
- https://github.com/ip7z/7zip/releases/tag/26.03
- https://github.com/ip7z/7zip/tree/26.03
- https://www.7-zip.org/download.html (source code downloads)
- https://github.com/ollm/7zip-bin-full
- LGPL-2.1 text: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

For binary redistribution, preserve all copyright/license notices and provide
corresponding 7-Zip source under applicable LGPL terms (for an offline product,
ship matching source or a compliant written source offer; a link alone is not a
substitute for the distributor's obligations). Leave binaries independently
replaceable; the plugin has not modified or statically linked their code.

RAR is read/decompress-only. The unRAR source cannot be used to develop or
re-create a RAR/WinRAR-compatible compression algorithm or archiver. This plugin
does not create RAR archives; tests use a hand-built store-only RAR fixture.

Cross-machine: npm install on the destination resolves local packaged binaries.
Windows x64/ia32/arm64/arm, macOS x64/arm64 and Linux x64/ia32/arm64/arm binaries
are included by the dependency. Verify its supported architecture, Unix execution
permissions, macOS gatekeeper and OS library compatibility in destination CI.
Unsupported/missing/unexecutable binaries fail clearly; system fallback is refused.
Only Windows x64 was tested here. Dependency tarball is approximately 80 MB unpacked.

  stated in the documentation and source comments that the code may
  not be used to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.
